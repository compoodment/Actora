# Actora Controls

Canonical control contract for all TUI surfaces. If it's not here, it's not official.

---

## Global contract

| Key | Action | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| Q | Advance month | Blocked: text input, search, popups, wizard, continuation, death screen |
| E | Skip time | Same blocks as Q |
| Backspace | Back / cancel | Navigation; overridden to delete-char in text input |
| Esc | Options popup | Outside text input/search; closes Options if already open |
| Enter | Proceed / confirm | Screen transitions, popup confirm, confirmation screens |
| [1] | Menu | Always visible; opens Browser / Actions / Profile |
| [2][3][4] | Reserved | Future domain systems |
| / | Open search | Any screen that supports it |
| W / ↑ | Move up / scroll up | Outside text input |
| S / ↓ | Move down / scroll down | Outside text input |
| A / ← | Move left / adjust value left | Outside text input |
| D / → | Move right / adjust value right | Outside text input |
| Tab | Switch Browser tabs | Browser only |
| Space | Toggle / select | Multi-select screens only |

**WASD are full movement aliases for arrow keys.** Same behavior, same context rules. In text input, WASD type characters (no movement).

**Adjustable value fields:** A/D (and ←→) adjust value when the row is active/focused, navigate when it's not. Active adjustable fields must visually render as `← value →`.

## Context override rules

| Context | What changes |
|---------|-------------|
| Text input field | Backspace = delete char, WASD = type characters, Esc = exit text mode |
| Search active | Backspace = delete char, WASD = type characters, Esc = exit search |
| Any popup open | Q/E blocked, [1] blocked |
| Character creation wizard | Q/E blocked, Esc blocked, [1] blocked |
| Continuation/death screen | Q/E blocked |

---

## Footer naming conventions

| Key | Display label |
|-----|--------------|
| ↑↓ with selection list | Move |
| ↑↓ with scrollable content | Scroll |
| Space | Select |
| Enter | Continue (or "Start" on final confirmation only) |
| Backspace | Back |
| Q | Quit (only in footer if Options is unavailable) |

Relationship wording: archived/former social ties use the player-facing label `Past`.

---

## Rules for adding new screens

1. Include `[1] Menu` and `Esc Options` in shell header
2. Include `[Backspace] Back` in footer if screen has a parent
3. Single-choice lists: highlighted row = live selection (no separate commit)
4. Adjustable fields: render `← value →` when active
5. Use `[Space] Select` only for true multi-select/toggle screens
6. Use `[Enter] Continue` for proceeding; never for popup confirm
7. Q/E must be blocked during any active input context
8. Follow footer order: navigation → actions → specialist → back
9. Visually separate shell chrome from body content (divider)
10. If layout is ambiguous after mockups, use a throwaway worktree to test real UI
11. Reference this doc in implementation prompts
12. After adding a screen, cascade-check: does screens.md need updating?

## Known issues (fix in next UI pass)

- Space/Enter overlap exists in current code on some screens — violation of the contract above
- BACK_KEYS aliases (Backspace/127/8) in `handle_actions_key` — should be Backspace only
- Q/E not yet wired as advance/skip (currently A/S) — full wiring needed in next UI pass
- WASD movement not yet implemented — current code uses arrows only
